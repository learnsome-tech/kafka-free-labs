# m01l01-02 · Start a network and broker

**Lesson:** [Why A Log And Not A Queue](https://learnsome.tech/learn/kafka-course/m01l01) (lesson 1.1, module 1: The Log: Topics, Partitions And Offsets) · Free  
**Check:** Checker

## Goal

You can explain why Kafka uses an append-only log rather than a delete-on-read queue, produce records to a topic, and consume them independently from two separate sessions.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/start.sh`](starter/start.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l01/m01l01-02/starter`
2. Read `start.sh`.
3. Edit `start.sh` and check it: `bash -n start.sh`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l01-02`.

## How to check

`./check m01l01-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `bash -n start.sh` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

**Read along, with a syntax check.** Running it needs Docker and the Kafka broker containers the course starts, which the lab sandbox does not have, so the site shows it with its recorded output.

This is a checker lab: it checks that the shell script parses (`bash -n`), without running it. The site shows the checker's report without grading; `./check` passes when the checker finds no errors.
